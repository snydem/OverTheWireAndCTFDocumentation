# Note from the Author:
Hey! My name is Christopher Snyder, and I am the one who has written all of these documentations.
These all describe my process for completing the relative wargames on OverTheWire, and I have posted them
here on github for you to view. I made these while begining my journey into learning network security, so if 
you see any problems, or maybe have an idea for a better solution, feel free to reach out!

Thanks a ton!

~ Christopher
